Among the current several optical switching network. OBS have been received extensive attention by taking advantage of statistical multiplexing and easily achieved. However, when congestion occurs in the OBS core. Large amount of burst have to be dropped because of bufferless. In this master project, I propose a close-loop congestion control scheme . On core routers side, they track network status and broadcast messages to edge nodes in certain period. Edge routers adjust transmission rate according to the feedback information. Through leaky bucket, the source flow-rate will be in control and this scheme will keep the network away from high blocking rate and then stay a stable state by avoiding congestion. Burst blocked rate, throughput trade-off are focus of this paper. Simulation results are also present to show the above scheme improve network performance and reduce the burst blocking probability.

% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the journal you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals frown on math
% in the abstract anyway.
