    In this studies, I review burst congestion control problems in optical burst switching networks from the viewpoint of network throughput maximizaation and to reduce additional signal requirement while minimizing burst loss. Burst collision occurs when two or more bursts access the same wavelength at the same time, and the occurrence becomes more frequent with the offered load increases. 
    Burst must be dropped since OBS don't provide buffer on intermediate core router. That is said contention is inherent to the OBS network. There are a lot of predecessors have done a lot of research on this topic. General speaking, it has two jointly operating mechanisms, namely a burst congestion detection and a burst control algorithm. In this work, I want to overcome the shortcoming of previous research and develop a new mechanism to enhace OBS network stability and make
    congestion controllable.
