\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, I proposed a congestion control mechanism based on feedback message sent from core router for OBS networks. Through the simulation result, I compared the overall data burst blocked rate for two cases, one with congestion control and the other without any control in single core node scenario and a small network scenario. It has been proven that this mechanism can reduce the burst blocked probability significantly. But also the throughput of network reduction, due to limit exceed data
burst inject to network, is tolerable. These and other topics, including implemented this mechanism with early dropping, behavior in larger network and what effect if core employ FDL line will focus on the future work.
